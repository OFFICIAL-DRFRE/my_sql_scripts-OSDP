Steps to migrate Data from one DB to another in SSMS.

Rename the database to something else. For example, mine was "Jira", so I renamed it "JiraTemp".
Create a new database named "Jira" and make sure to set the right collation. Simply select the page "Options" and change the collation.
Once created, go back to "JiraTemp", right click it, "Tasks -> Generate Scripts...".
Select "Script entire database and all database objects".
Select "Save to new query window", then select "Advanced"
Change the value of "Script for Server Version" to the desired value
Enable "Script Object-Level Permissions", "Script Owner" and "Script Full-Text Indexes"
Leave everything else as is or personalize it if you wish.
Once generated, delete the "CREATE DATABASE" section. Replace "JiraTemp" with "Jira".
Run the script. The entire database structure and permissions of the database is now replicated to "Jira".
Before we copy the data, we need to disable all constraints. Execute the following command to do so in the database "Jira": EXEC sp_msforeachtable "ALTER TABLE ? NOCHECK CONSTRAINT all"
Now the data needs to be transferred. To do so, simply right click "JiraTemp", then select "Tasks -> Export Data..."
Select as data source and destination the OLE DB Provider for SQL Server.
Source database is "JiraTemp"
Destination database is "Jira"
The server name is technically the same for source and destination (except if you've created the database on another server).
Select "Copy data from one or another tables or views"
Select all tables except views. Then, when still highlighted, click on "Edit Mappings". Check "Enable identity insert"
Click OK, Next, then Finish
Data transfer can take a while. Once finished, execute the following command to re enable all constraints: exec sp_msforeachtable @command1="print '?'", @command2="ALTER TABLE ? WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT all"
